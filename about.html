        Hello, my name is Liezzy Mihalko. I am honored to have you interested in
        knowing more about me and incredibly thrilled to have the opportunity to
        share a little bit about myself. While I am relatively new to the world
        of Front-End Engineering, my passion to express my creativity through
        technology and my determination to learn and grow in this field have
        kept me motivated in this journey. From a young age, I found myself
        drawn to computers and fascinated by the possibilities they offer. My
        curiosity and enthusiasm have propelled me to pursue a career in
        Software Engineering. Although I may lack formal experience, I am a
        dedicated learner and have invested countless hours in self-study
        gaining my certifications through completed workshops in "SheCodes" and
        online resources to build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Responsive Web Design, React, and working on real world projects. I am
        confident in my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and apply them
        effectively. One aspect that excites me about Front-End Engineering is
        the ability to bring design concepts to life. With my eye for aesthetics
        and attention to detail, I am committed to creating visually appealing
        and functional websites. Moreover, I understand the importance of
        collaboration in the software development process. As a team player, I
        value effective communication and thrive in an environment where
        different perspectives come together to create innovative solutions. I
        am always eager to learn from experienced professionals and contribute
        my ideas to the team.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center opacity-75">
        In addition, I know continuous learning is a fundamental aspect of
        Front-end Engineering, and I embrace this mindset wholeheartedly; that
        is one of many reasons why I chose this career path. I stay updated with
        the latest industry trends, attend webinars and conferences, and
        actively engage in online communities to expand my knowledge and stay
        ahead in this ever-evolving field. Beyond the technical realm, I possess
        excellent problem-solving skills, the ability to communicate
        effectively, and think critically. I approach challenges with a positive
        attitude and a determination to find creative solutions. I believe that
        perseverance and adaptability are essential traits for success in the
        rapidly changing landscape of technology. Outside of my professional
        pursuits, I enjoy exploring creative outlets such as photography and
        illustration art. These hobbies have nurtured my creativity and have
        taught me to approach problem-solving from different angles while
        trusting the process of a new project. I find inspiration in the world
        around me and seek to bring that inspiration into my work. In
        conclusion, while I may be a front-end engineer with limited
        professional experience, I am passionate, dedicated, and eager to
        contribute to the field. I am committed to continuously honing my
        skills, collaborating with others, and creating meaningful and
        delightful user experiences. I am excited about the possibilities that
        lie ahead and look forward to making a positive impact as a Front-End
        Engineer.
