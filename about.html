        Hello, my name is Liezzy Mihalko. I am honored to have you interested in
        knowing more about me and incredibly thrilled to have the opportunity to
        share a little bit about myself. While I am relatively new to the world
        of Front-End Engineering, my passion to express my creativity through
        technology and my determination to learn and grow in this field have
        been my motives in this journey. From a young age, I found myself drawn
        to computers and fascinated by the possibilities they offer. This
        curiosity and enthusiasm have propelled me to pursue a career in
        Software Engineering. Although I may lack formal experience, I am a
        dedicated learner and have invested countless hours in self-study
        gaining my certifications through completed workshops in "SheCodes" and
        online resources to build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Responsive Web Design, and React. I am confident in my ability to
        quickly grasp new concepts and apply them effectively. One aspect that
        excites me about Front-End Engineering is the ability to bring design
        concepts to life. I believe that a beautiful and intuitive user
        interface is crucial for creating a positive user experience. With my
        eye for aesthetics and attention to detail, I am committed to creating
        visually appealing and functional websites. Moreover, I understand the
        importance of collaboration in the software development process. As a
        team player, I value effective communication and thrive in an
        environment where different perspectives come together to create
        innovative solutions. I am always eager to learn from experienced
        professionals and contribute my ideas to the team.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center opacity-75">
        In addition to technical skills, I am also a strong advocate for
        user-centered design. I believe in putting the end-users at the
        forefront of the development process and crafting interfaces that meet
        their needs and expectations. Empathy and usability are key principles
        that guide my approach to front-end engineering. Continuous learning is
        a fundamental aspect of front-end engineering, and I embrace this
        mindset wholeheartedly. I stay updated with the latest industry trends,
        attend webinars and conferences, and actively engage in online
        communities to expand my knowledge and stay ahead in this ever-evolving
        field. Beyond the technical realm, I possess excellent problem-solving
        skills and the ability to think critically. I approach challenges with a
        positive attitude and a determination to find creative solutions. I
        believe that perseverance and adaptability are essential traits for
        success in the rapidly changing landscape of technology. Outside of my
        professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring creative outlets such as
        photography and graphic design. These hobbies have nurtured my
        creativity and have taught me to approach problem-solving from different
        angles. I find inspiration in the world around me and seek to bring that
        inspiration into my work as a front-end engineer. In conclusion, while I
        may be a front-end engineer with limited professional experience, I am
        passionate, dedicated, and eager to contribute to the field. I am
        committed to continuously honing my skills, collaborating with others,
        and creating meaningful and delightful user experiences. I am excited
        about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to making a
        positive impact as a front-end engineer.
